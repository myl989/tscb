This application is intended to be used to help transcribe a piece of audio into text. It has a command-line format. (Full API to be added)

To use, first place the audio file in a WAV format into the 'resources' folder. Then, run `init [file_name].wav` to initialize the transcriber. Finally, run `transcribe` to transcribe the text. To transcribe another piece of text, run `purge`, and replace the .wav file, and repeat the processes.

List of the commands:
**`init [file_name].wav`**
Initialises the audio by splitting it into 1-minute-sized chunks.

**`transcribe`**
Transcribes to text using Google Transcribe API.

**`purge`**
Deletes the audio chunks.

**`end`**
Exits the program.
